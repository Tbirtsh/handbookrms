    <h1>Electronic Devices</h1>
    <p>Students are permitted to bring personal electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, laptops) to school
      in accordance with the school's policy.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, personal electronic devices should be turned off and kept out of sight during the school
      day. They should not be used for making calls, sending or receiving messages, or connecting to the internet
      without specific permission from school personnel.</p>
    <p>Using personal electronic devices in a responsible manner is expected, and students should comply with all
      other aspects of the student code of conduct.</p>
    <p>In case of inappropriate technology use, the item may be confiscated, and a parent/guardian will be required
      to pick it up, providing proper identification and signature.</p>
